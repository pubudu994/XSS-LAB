XSS LAB - Challenge Write-up

Introduction :
Welcome to the reflected XSS in HTML context challenge. in this room, you will be exploring a classic reflected Cross-site-scripting vulnerability. your task is to identify and exploit this vulnerability in the web application and capture the hidden flag. Xss attacks can allow attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to severe consequences.

Challenge Setup :
You are presented with a basic web application that includes a search feature. this search page does not properly sanitize the user's input, which leads to a reflected XSS vulnerability. You aim to find this vulnerability, inject a malicious script, and hide the flag.

Include :
9 short answer questions.
1 practical.

Description :
XSS Question Lab - This lab is designed to simulate real-world scenarios where Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities may occur. Participants will learn to identify and exploit XSS by injecting malicious scripts into vulnerable inputs. The goal is to understand the impact of XSS, including session hijacking, information theft, and defacement while exploring techniques to mitigate such vulnerabilities through secure coding practices and input validation.
